"""Skills Assessment - Object Orientation"""

"""Part 1: Discussion
1. The three main design advantages that object orientation can provide are:
    Abstraction - Hides details that we do not need to know regarding methods
    Encapsulation - Keeps data and methods close together
    Polymorphism - Interchangeability of components

2. A class is a type of thing, either defined by Python (i.e. String, File) or by the user (i.e. Pet).

3. An instance attribute is an attribute specific to the instance/object.

4. A method is a function defined on a class that takes the instance itself, 'self' as its first parameter.

5. An instance in object orientation, is an individual instance/object of a class. For examples, there may be many instances of Dog, such as fido, arfy, barky, sparky, etc. which are different from each other but are generalized as being a Dog.

6. A class attribute is applicable to all instances, but an instance attribute is specific to that instance. For example, a class attribute for the class Dog could be number of legs. Dogs generally have 4 legs. However, an instance of Dog, such as fido, may have been born with 3 legs, so it would have an instance attribute of 3 legs. This way, when we look up number of legs for fido, we look to its instance attribute first and if a value is found, we would not look for the class attribute.
